  "long_description": "Grover's algorithm searches an unstructured database of N items in O(\u221aN) queries, compared to O(N) classically. The algorithm applies a phase oracle to mark the target state, followed by a diffusion operator that amplifies its amplitude. After O(\u221aN) iterations, the target is measured with high probability. This circuit searches a 2-qubit space (N=4) for |11\u27e9 using a phase kickback oracle.",
